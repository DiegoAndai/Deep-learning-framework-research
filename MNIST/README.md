#Evaluation of Keras, MXNet, TensorFlow and Torch through an MNIST classifier implementation

We wondered, as beginners in the area of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, which were the main differences between the frameworks available in this area, but also which advantages and disadvantages these have depending on the context of development. So in order to pacify our bewilderment, we took the time to implement the so called "Hello World!!!" of neural networks, the MNIST handwriten digit classification, in four well known frameworks: Keras, MXNet, TensorFlow and Torch.
