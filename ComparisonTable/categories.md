##Categories for framework comparison table:

The next are ideas for categories to compare multiple NN frameworks. On completion, here should be a description for every category that will go on the comparison table.

	1)  complexity level (the framework comes ready to implement nn or is it a base to build on)*
	2)  number of tutorials*
	3)  principal uses for the framework*
	4)  docs clarity*
	5)  docs completeness*
	6)  languages*
	7)  gpu/cpu*
	8)  overall performance*
	9)  dependencies*
	10) previous knowledge required*
	11) computer requirements*
	12) OS list (development/deployment)*
	13) sintaxis complexity*
	14) associated entities (organizations, researchers, companies)*
	15) principal tasks covered (for neural network developing)*
	16) tasks not covered (for neural network developing)*
	17) support from developers/experts
	18) compatible libraries (that can be used side by side for extending functionality)
	19) examples’ quality, quantity and type
	20) last actualization
	21) launch date
	22) developing team
	23) extra or remarkable features (for neural network developing)
	24) external contribution (is it open source, how much the community contributes)
	25) ‘installing and using for the first time with one of the examples provided’
	26) ‘installing and using for the first time with own code’
	27) comments*, observations for remarkable or bad/missing behavior/characteristics
  
Marked (*) categories should go on the principal info chart, the others can be seen if more info is required.

25 and 26 would be sections that resume a user's first experience thoughts about the framework
