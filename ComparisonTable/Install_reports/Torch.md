**Name**: Torch </br>
[Installation guide](http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html#_)

**SO**: Ubuntu </br>
**Method**: pip </br>
**Difficulty**: low </br>
**Docs quality**: high </br>
**Comments**: few commands to install.

**SO**: Mac OSX </br>
**Method**: git clone and file run </br>
**Difficulty**: low </br>
**Docs quality**: high </br>
**Comments**: didn't work until dependencies where on the exact version required, those that I had previusly had to be reinstalled to the right version. Xcode developer command line must be installed. Had to add path manually, the install guide says you must add it to ~/.profile but I found that's better to add it to ~/.bash_profile so you don't have to source it everytime the terminal opens, cause this last one sources automatically. If you add it to the former one, you'll have to source everytime or the ~~~~th~~~~ command won't work and torch won't launch. 

**Final thoughts**: installation time may vary depending on network connection and computer capabilities. </br>
**Testing installation**:
