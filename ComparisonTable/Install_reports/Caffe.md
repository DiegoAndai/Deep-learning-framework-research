**Name**: Caffe </br>
**[Installation guide](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html)**

**OS**: Mac OSX </br>
**Method**: brew </br>
**Difficulty**: high</br>
**Docs quality**: medium </br>
**Comments**: Check if you have a CUDA capable NVIDIA graphic card. The python boost made my computer overheat. At the moment I was unexperienced with compilation so that gave me a hard time. Had to add manually especifications to makefile, I had trouble with this because the anaconda path to the python folder that the install guide requires didn't work for me, it couldn't find the Python.h file. To solve this, I used a python2.7 folder installed appart from anaconda, directly from the python site. 

**Final thoughts**: </br>
**Testing installation**:
