**OS**: Ubuntu </br>
**Method**: pip </br>
**Difficulty**: low</br>
**Docs quality**: high </br>
**Comments**: Installation succeded, but theano.test() failed at first with 80 errors. Noticed that a python module called nose-parameterized was not installed and apparently required (at least by the test function). After installing nose-parameterized with pip, Theano's test function succeded with skipped tests which are normal according to the guide.

**Final thoughts**: </br>
**Testing installation**:
